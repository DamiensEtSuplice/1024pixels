# One Thousand~ Pixels
Workshop at Master of Arts in Interaction Design, Mendrisio
9–13 January 2023

# Project Brief
The aim of the workshop is to embrace constratints and develop ideas around limits. 
Develop and idea and a working prototype using a 32×32 RGB LED matrix. 

# Topics
- Idea driven development and research 
- Realtime graphics and animation concepts 
- Serial communication 
- Quick prototyping 

# Part list
- RGB LED matrix 32x32 P5 (P5 means that the LED pitch is 5mm)
- HUB75 ribbon cable (usually comes with the matrix)
- 5V power cable for the LED matrix
- 5V power supply (3A minimum), plus cables
- [Teensy 4.0 or 4.1 development board](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) (a Teensy 3.2 will do but has limited memory)
- [SmartMatrix shield](https://docs.pixelmatix.com/SmartMatrix/) (not strictly necessary but handy to quickly connect the microcontroller)
- Micro-USB cable

# Software requirements
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) 
- [Processing IDE](https://www.processing.org/download/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

# Examples
All the examples rely on the [SmartMatrix](https://github.com/pixelmatix/SmartMatrix) library for Arduino.
The many features of the library are not demonstrated: the libraray comes with an extensive collection of examples.
